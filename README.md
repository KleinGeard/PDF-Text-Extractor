# PDF-Text-Extractor

This is a program made to convert directories of pdf files into txt. 

it uses Apache PDFBox 2.0.0 which you can download here: https://pdfbox.apache.org/download.cgi 

(pdfbox-2.0.0-RC3.jar)

## TO USE THIS PROGRAM

• Import the project into eclipse.

• Add a user library using "pdfbox-2.0.0-RC3.jar" (see download above).

• Run the program.

• Select a Target Folder (The folder containing the pdf documents you wish to have converted).

• Select a Destination Folder (The folder you wish the converted txt documents to be saved to.)

• Click "Convert".

• Once it is done the txt documents should be in the your chosen destination folder.

## WHY USE THIS PROGRAM?

If you Google "pdf to text" you will see quite a few different results, so why should you use this?

#### batch run folders
  
Almost all of the pdf to txt converters already out there limit you to one pdf at a time, meaning if you had several hundred files it would take hours to do it all manually.

With PDF-Text-Extractor you can convert entire directories containing as many pdf files as you want.

#### No limits to file size

Most pdf to txt converters have a very small limit on the size of the files you can convert and often require you to sign up to an expensive monthly subscription in order to exceed that.

PDF-TextExtractor has no limit to the size of the files you can convert, and it's free.

#### Respectable to the original formatting

PDF-Text-Extractor retains the spaces, line-breaks and carriage-returns that appear in the pdf document.

Surprisingly most of the pdf to text converters already out there don't even do this.

#### It's fast

A few pdf to text converters that I've tried took upwards of 5 minutes just to give you the text from a single 8.9mb pdf document.

PDF-Text-Extractor can do this pretty much instantly.

#### Privacy and security

With PDF-Text-Extractor you don't need to upload your potentially confidential pdf documents to some foreign server where they may be read or stolen and you don't need to give anyone your email in order to use it.

## Limitations
 
• Some pdf documents are made up of scanned images rather than actual text. Unfortunately these can not be converted.

• Tables, graphs, maps, lists, indexes, etc, may come out funny. This just happens to be the way the text is stored in the file.

• Sometimes what loopks like a group of linebreaks is actually just a gap so linebreaks aren't added.
